Q. 17 Use a RHEL System Role 
• Create a playbook name selinux.yml and use system roles to: 
• Set selinux mode as enforcing in all manage node

solution

Go to SELinux System Role 
$ cd /usr/share/ansible/roles/rhel-system-roles.selinux 
$ vim README.md

Go to “” ### selinux role “” line 
We will find the sample playbook as well the parameter to set selinux_state as 
enforcing so we will 

$ vim selinux.yml

(This is how to playbook will look after copying and setting the alignments) 
 
• To Verify: 
• ansible all -m command -a “cat /etc/selinux/config”
