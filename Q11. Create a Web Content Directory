Q11. Create a Web Content Directory 
• Create a playbook called /home/admin/ansible/webcontent.yml as follows: 
- The playbook runs managed node in the dev host group 
• Create the directory /webdev with the following requirement: 
- it is owner by the webdev group 
- it has regular permissions:
owner=read+write+execute,group=r+w+x,other=r+x 
- it has special permission: set group GID 
• Symbolically link /webdev to /var/www/html/webdev 
• Create the file /web/index.html with a single line of text that reads: Development 
• Browsing this directory on host in the dev host group (for example: http://
system1.domain1.example.com/webdev) gives the following output: 
Development

solution:
vim web.yml 
$ ansible-playbook web.yml 
• To Verify: 
• ansible all -m command -a “ls -ldZ /webdev” 
• ansible all -m command -a “cat /var/www/html/webdev/index.html”
