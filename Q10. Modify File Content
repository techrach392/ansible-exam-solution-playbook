Q10. Modify File Content 
Create a playbook called /home/admin/ansible/issue.yml 
• The playbook runs on all inventory hosts 
• The playbook replaces the content of /etc/issue with a single line of text as follows: 
- On host is the dev host group, the line reads: Development
- On hosts in the test host group, the line read: Test 
- On hosts in the prod hosts group, the line read: Production

solution:
$ vim modify.yml
$ ansible-playbook modify.yml 
• To Verify: 
• ansible all -m command -a “cat /etc/issue”
