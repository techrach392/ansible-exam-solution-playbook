Q7. Creating and Using a Role
 • Create a role called apache in /home/admin/ansible/roles with the following requirement: 
- The httpd package is install, enabled on boot and started 
- The Firewall is enabled & running with a rule to allow access the web server 
- A template file index.html.j2 exists and is used to create the file /var/www/html/index.html with the content:
“Welcome to HOSTNAME ON IPADDRESS” HOSTNAME is the fqdn of the managed nodes and IPADDRESS is the ip address of managed host
• create a playbook called /home/admin/ansible/newrole.yml that uses this role as follow: The Playbook runs on host in the webservers host group
Solution:
$ cd /home/devops/ansible/roles
$ ansible-galaxy init apache
$ cd apache/tasks 
$ vim main.yml
$ cd ../template 
$ vim index.html.j2

$ cd /ansible/httpd.yml


$ ansible-playbook httpd.yml –syntax-check
$ ansible-playbook httpd.yml 
$ cd /var/www/html/
$ vi index.html

To verify
 . To Give ip address or hostname in web browser and it will show proper output as per our file entry, or
 • ansible all -m command -a “curl localhost”
