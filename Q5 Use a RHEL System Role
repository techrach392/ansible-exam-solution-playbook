Q5. 
Use a RHEL System Role 
• Use a RHEL system role Install the RHEL System role package & create a playbook called /home/admin/ansible/timesync.yml that: - 
• Runs on all managed nodes 
- Uses the timesync role 
- Configures the role to use the currently active NTP provider 
- Configure the role to use the time server 172.24.1.254
 - Configure the role to enable the iburst parameter
Solution:
Come as Root User and run:
 $ yum install rhel-system-roles
 $ cd /usr/share/ansible/roles/rhel-system-roles.timesync
 $ vim README.md
Scroll down to Example Playbook and copy the first one completely 
$ su – admin 
$ cd ansible 
$ vim timesync.yml
(Paste what we copied and correct the alignment)
