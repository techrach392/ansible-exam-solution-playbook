nodes that does thefollowing: 
• Creates a logical volume with these requirement: 
- The logical Volume is Created in the research volume group 
- The logical volume name is data 
- The logical volume size is 1500 Mib 
- Format the logical volume with the ext4 file system 
• If the requested logical volume size cannot be created, the error message
“ Could not create logical volume of that size ” 
 should be displayed and size 800 MiB should be used instead. 
• If the volume research does not exist, the error message 
“ Volume group does not exist “ 
 should be displayed 
• Do NOT mount the logical volume in any way

$ vim partition.yml 
$ ansible-playbook partition.yml
